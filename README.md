## Required tools

In order to run examples from this repository you will need a few tools installed on your machine:

### wabt

Follow this [link](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-prebuilt-binaries) to install
pre-build binaries. E.g. for Fedora I used:

```shell
sudo dnf install wabt
```
